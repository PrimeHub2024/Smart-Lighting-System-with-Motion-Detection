# Smart-Lighting-System-with-Motion-Detection (SLSMD)
-
The Smart Lighting and Motion Detection System is an energy-efficient solution that automates lighting based on motion detection. 
Using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, the system detects motion and signals the STM32 Nucleo microcontroller to activate LEDs. After a predefined timeout, if no motion is detected, the LEDs automatically turn off. 
The project integrates components like a PIR sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), and LEDs, ensuring efficient power usage by illuminating only when necessary.
This system is ideal for homes, offices, and public spaces, offering enhanced convenience, reduced energy wastage, and scalability for various applications.
